# Image-Compressor-By-Max-Pooling

## Project Overview ;

- This project is a Streamlit-based Image Compression Web Application that compresses images using the Max Pooling technique, a concept widely used in Computer Vision and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
- The application reduces image size while preserving important visual features by applying pooling operations separately on RGB channels.

## Features :

- Upload images directly from your device
- Image compression using Max Pooling
- Before vs After comparison
- Automatic size reduction display
- Interactive Web Interface

 ## Compression Technique :

The application uses:

**Max Pooling Algorithm :**

Max Pooling reduces image dimensions by selecting the maximum pixel value from a defined window.

**Steps:**

1. Image converted into NumPy array
2. RGB channels separated
3. Max pooling applied on each channel
4. Channels merged again
5. Compressed image generated

## How It Works :

1. User uploads an image.
2. Image is converted into RGB arrays.
3. Max Pooling operation compresses image dimensions.
4. Compressed image is displayed.
5. Size comparison is shown instantly.

## Application Output :

- Original Image
- Compressed Image
- Storage Size Comparison
